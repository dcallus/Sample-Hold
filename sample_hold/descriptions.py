It's really two modules in one: a totally unique analogue bassdrum and a voltage controlled distortion module! (with the same topology as batteryACID!)

- analogue bassdrum circuitry capable of vanilla TR-808 sounds
- built in voltage controlled distortion (batteryACID distortion)
- distortion accepts external inputs when not being used with kick drum (great for acid synth leads)
- voltage control of distortion amount
- voltage control of decay from short kicks to long "ooooooooomphs"
- voltage control of pitch (approximates v/oct response, but not musically tuned)
- non-invasive analogue optocouplers used for voltage control, thus, completely vintage sounds can still be had if that's what you're after!
- completely redesigned, hi-fi signal chain spares no expense by replacing cheap transistor amplifiers with low noise opamp equivalents
- you can dial in super hot, modular level output levels (up to 20Vp-p!)"""

• SCAN FREQ CV forms a unique form of timbre control, making the Machine act like a complex oscillator at its WAVES output
• The ENABLE input allows you to gate the wavescanner on and off with a CV or gate signal

Architecture of the Machine
The Mutant Machine is a dynamic analog instrument capable of generating a wide palette of sounds, ranging from various forms of analog percussion to complex drones and oscillations. To achieve this, the Machine features two synthesis sections which are summed together at the final output: MEMBRANE and SNAPPY. Like the other Mutant Drums, the MEMBRANE and SNAPPY circuits began their mutation as classic analog percussion techniques and have been reimagined for 21st century modular synthesis.

The MEMBRANE forms the main body of the sound by way of two analog VCOs, and the SNAPPY section further adds to the timbre by contributing noisy elements to the mix. A noisy CLICK which occurs at the beginning of the SNAPPY sound can have its volume adjusted independent of the main decaying SNAPPY texture.

The waveforms which make up the MEMBRANE can be selected manually by button press, or the WAVESCANNER can be used to automatically scan through the available analog waveforms. By modulating the frequency through which waves are scanned, unique, complex sounds are created.

Experimentation is encouraged by the many modulation inputs and outputs available to you. The Machine features 8 CV and gate inputs for modulation as well as two external audio inputs, for bringing other modules into the Machine’s core. There are many audio outputs for maximum versatility, allowing you to use the Machine to create drones and alien timbres for use elsewhere in the modular analog system."""

a_160_5_description = """Voltage Controlled Clock Multiplier / Ratcheting Controller

Module A-160-5 is a voltage controlled clock multiplier. The incoming clock signal (socket Clock In) is multiplied by a factor that depends upon the control voltage on socket CV In (0...+5V) and the position of the Mode switch. The multiplied clock signal is available at the socket Clock Out. According to the position of the Mode switch different clock multiplying factors are assigned to the control voltage. With 0V CV no clock output is generated. With increasing CV integer factors (left position of the mode switch), power of two factors (middle position) or a mix of both (right position) are obtained. Nine LEDs are used to show the currently selected multiplying factor. In addition two LEDs are used to display the incoming and outgoing clock signal.

The module can be used for all kind of clock multiplying applications. One important example is the generation of so-called ratcheting sequences. The band Tangerine Dream is famous for this kind of sequences. A normal sequencer generates only one gate signal per step. A ratcheting sequence may have also more than one gate pulses per step. This function can be obtained by using the A-160-5: one CV output of the sequencer is used to define the number of gate pulses per step. If the control of the step in question is fully CCW the generated CV is 0V and no gate signal is generated (mute of the step). When the control of the step in question is turned clockwise one, two or more gate pulses are generated depending upon the position of the mode switch and the voltage generated by the CV at this step.

Note: Due to the nature of clock multiplying it takes a few input clock pulses until the clock output is stable. One has to average a few input clock pulses to generate the multiplied clock output signal. Even when the input clock frequency changes it will take a few cycles until the output clock signal is correct as the module cannot forsee the future of the clock input signal. The generated clock output signal is derived from the last few cycles of the clock input signal. Consequently the module should be driven only by a clock signal with constant or slowly changing frequency."""

pittsburgh_lpg_description = """Triple Mode Filter, VCA, Lopass Gate

The Pittsburgh Modular Lopass Gate module is a new take on a classic. Our intention was not to clone but to reengineer and expand on the original idea. Our module includes an amazing new self-oscillating resonance circuit and a quieter vactrol based VCA circuit with true unity gain. Voltage control of the module is handled using an invertible, attenuated input and ping input. The ping input takes any gate or square wave and converts it into a very tight trigger used to ping the vactrol.

In lowpass filter mode, frequency sweeps are warm and buttery and resonance is smooth and controlled until it gets near self oscillation. At this point the Pittsburgh Modular LPG module turns into a shouting beast. High resonance creates an edgier, shattered, more direct sound. It never loses control but is always teetering on the edge. Having both the smooth and snarling responses available creates a filter that is perfect for almost any situation.

In VCA mode, we worked very hard to reduce the bleed associated with most lopass gate circuits without resorting to tricks like adding an a traditional VCA after the vactrol circuit. After considerable effort, we succeeded in creating a vactrol based VCA that is identical or better in performance to our 2164 based Dual VCA module.

All the work we did on the filter and VCA come together with the lopass gate mode. The buttery warmth of the filter teams with the best attributes of the vactrol based VCA to create an impressive take on the original lopass gate.

HISTORY AND THEORY BEHIND THE LOPASS GATE
The lopass gate module is unique in the way that it simulates the characteristics of natural instruments. When used in lopass gate mode, louder sounds contain more harmonic content and quieter sounds contain less harmonic content. This is not the case when using a standard VCA such as the Pittsburgh Modular Dual VCA module. A standard VCA simply changes the loudness of the sound without changing the harmonic content. There is no reason that synthesizers need to simulate how acoustic instruments function but because of how it affects the harmonic content of sound, a lowpass gate sounds more organic or natural compared to a standard filter/vca chain.

The circuitry behind the lopass gate has evolved over the years to include resonance and more complex modulation options but the ability to switch between voltage controlled amplifier, low pass filter, and a third mode which uses both the VCA and filter together remains at the core of the modules functionality. A lot of the characteristics associated with the lopass gate circuit come from the use of vactrols. A vactrol is an optoelectronic device consisting of an LED and light detector enclosed in a light tight package. The elements of the vactrol are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. When the LED within the vactrol turns on, the light detector reacts very quickly creating a very sharp attack, however, when the LED turns off, the light detector within the vactrol does not react as quickly and closes more slowly. That slow decay or ringing is the quality most associated with the lopass gate. Therefore, using a very short trigger to ping the vactrol will not result in a very short sound, instead the result is an organic percussive sound with an natural sounding decay.

The lopass gate uses a Sallen-Key filter. The Sallen-Key filter is a 2 pole 12db filter with a very buttery, natural sound. In addition to the lopass gate, the Sallen-Key filter was used as the core of Korg's classic MS-10 and MS-20 filters. Although the Korg filters are remembered for their biting growl, that has more to do with the resonance then with the filter itself."""
